# test_500px_api

### Test exercise.
#### Description:
- create app to load and display photos from 500px;
- use 500px API;
- display list and detailed view;
- make option to share photo url;
- 3rd party libraries allowed;

#### Possible improvements:
Because this is only test exercise with approximate 2 hours for completeion, it's built accordingly.
So,
- no tests was written (no TDD used here);
- no architecture (everything in in one module);
- no models separation (data, domain, view);
- no event bus, streams, services, etc.;
- no LeakCanary testing;
- no detailed javadocs;
